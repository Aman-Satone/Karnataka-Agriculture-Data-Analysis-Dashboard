# 🌾 Karnataka Agriculture Data Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive analysis of Karnataka's agricultural data using Power BI and Excel. The goal is to provide insights into crop production, yield trends, and district-wise performance to support better agricultural decision-making.

---

## 📌 1. Problem Statement

Karnataka faces challenges in achieving optimal agricultural productivity due to uneven rainfall, infrastructure gaps, and changing cropping patterns. This project analyzes historical crop data to support targeted agricultural planning.

---

## 📈 2. Executive Summary

### 🔍 Key Findings
- South Karnataka shows consistently better yields than northern districts.
- Paddy and Jowar dominate cultivation area, but pulses and oilseeds offer potential for diversification.
- Rain-fed regions are more susceptible to productivity drops.

### ✅ Recommendations
- Expand irrigation coverage in central and northern districts.
- Promote millets and pulses in water-scarce regions.
- Focus on yield improvement through technology and education.

---

## 🎯 3. Introduction

### Objective
To analyze agricultural crop data across districts and years to discover trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement.

### Background
Agriculture forms a key component of Karnataka’s economy. Understanding yield and area trends can inform policy and resource allocation.

---

## 💡 7. Insights & Recommendations

- Certain districts underperform despite large cultivation areas.
- Crops like Ragi and Tur have stable yield potential with low investment.
- Infrastructure and irrigation correlate strongly with better yields.

**Recommendations:**
- Promote water-efficient crops in rain-fed zones.
- Encourage intercropping and crop rotation.
- Use targeted subsidies and training programs.
